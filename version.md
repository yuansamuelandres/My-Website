# Upcoming Updates
- tasks-app.html
    - Integrating  by adding different sections & categories (lectures to do, lectures to study, lectures to review, lectures to print).
    - Transforming this app into an ultimate lectures management system.
        - We'll do this by presenting two different UIs (*both of them will be apparantly different*)
            - Mobile screen sizes, representing the categories in row buttons. When clicked the div containing the related app appears.
            - Desktop screen sizes, will be **_maybe_** represented by four columns in a grid or a flex-box.
